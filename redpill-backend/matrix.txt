The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis. It stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano.

The film depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality, the Matrix, created by intelligent machines to distract humans while using their bodies as a power source. When computer programmer Thomas Anderson, who goes by the hacker alias Neo, uncovers the truth, he is drawn into a rebellion against the machines along with other people who have been freed from the Matrix.

Key characters include:
- Neo (Thomas Anderson): The protagonist, a computer programmer and hacker who discovers the truth about the Matrix and is believed to be 'The One'.
- Morpheus: A legendary hacker and rebel leader who believes Neo is 'The One' and frees him from the Matrix.
- Trinity: A mysterious hacker and Neo's love interest, part of Morpheus's crew.
- Agent Smith: A sentient computer program within the Matrix, an antagonist who can take over human bodies.
- The Oracle: A prophetic program within the Matrix who guides Neo.

The film explores philosophical and spiritual ideas, including existentialism, free will, choice, and the nature of reality. It is known for its innovative visual effects, particularly the 'bullet time' effect.

The Matrix spawned two sequels, The Matrix Reloaded (2003) and The Matrix Revolutions (2003), and a fourth film, The Matrix Resurrections (2021). It also led to various spin-offs, including animated shorts (The Animatrix), comic books, and video games.
